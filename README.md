# pinepain/devtools 

This is a [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/brew-tap.md)
with various formulae I use for development.


## Installation.

Just `brew tap pinepain/devtools` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from another tap, you can `brew install `pinepain/devtools/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL: `brew install https://raw.github.com/pinepain/homebrew-devtools/master/<formula>.rb`


## Provided tools:

 - [git-subsplit](https://github.com/dflydev/git-subsplit) - automate and simplify the process of managing one-way
   read-only git subtree splits.
